    <h1>Don’t Want to Exercise? Use the Braveheart Technique</h1>

    <h2><strong>We all have those moments when we don’t feel like exercising.</strong></h2>

<p>If you’re a New Year’s resolutioner, “it” tends to happen right around this part of January.  Some have already given up, while others didn’t even bother starting.  Not Nerd Fitness Rebels though!</p>

<p>We know that when building habits, missing more than a day in a row is recipe for disaster.  This is why we follow through with our Hard Hat Challenges and make sure we stay on target until that habit becomes automatic.</p>
   
    <h3>But what do we do on those days when it seems like everything is working against us?</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>t’s REALLY cold outside, and we don’t feel like running.</li>
    <li>We just got home from a long day of work, and don’t feel like doing the Star Wars Workout.
        </li>
    <li>The alarm clock is going off, it’s dark outside, and it’s all warm and cozy in our beds.</li>
    </ul>
    
<p>How do you get from that point of lethargy to exercising, when you just don’t feel like it?  You know you should, you know it’s good for you, and you know you need to…but you just struggle to put one foot in front of the other.</p>
